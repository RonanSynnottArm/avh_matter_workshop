    Control Arm Virtual Hardware with API.
---
## Overview

In this section we will learn how to control Arm Virtual Hardware via the [AVH API](https://app.avh.arm.com/api/docs). This can be used stand-alone, or as part of your overall CI/CD workflow. Applications to interface with the API can be written in JavaScript, Python, or C. This example uses JavaScript.

## Pre-requisites

* Arm Virtual Hardware instances managed by GitHub Actions as per [previous section](/devsummit22/cicd_sh).
* Active GitHub account to host repository

GitHub now requires a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) when pushing remote updates.

If you do not know your token, you can create a new one via `Settings` > `Developer Settings` > `Personal access tokens`.

Ensure you have enabled the token to `Update GitHub Action workflows`.

You may wish to create a local scratchpad text file containing the below details (which will be unique to you), so that you can easily copy-and-paste from. These will be used frequently during this workshop.
```
YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
git config --global user.name "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME"
git config --global user.email YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS
```

## Detailed Instructions

We shall extend the workflow from the previous section to automatically transmit the `chip-tool` commands.

### Set up API Token

In either `Arm Virtual Hardware` browser, navigate to `Profile` > `API`.

Generate and copy your `API Token`. This is a unique key that enables remote access to your instance(s).

In the GitHub browser, go to your forked repository, and navigate to `Settings` > `Secrets` > `Actions`.

Create a `New repository secret`. Name the secret:
```console
API_TOKEN
```
Paste the above `API Token` as the secret value.

The secret name must be exactly `API_TOKEN`, as this is used by the workflow later.

### Modify the workflow

To prevent spurious runs of the workflow, navigate to the `Actions` tab of your repository, select the `Matter_CICD_Demo` workflow, and `disable workflow` from the `...` pulldown (to the right of the `Filter workflow runs` textbox).

Navigate to the `connectedhomeip/.github/workflows` folder and edit the `cicd_demo.yml` workflow (it is easiest to do this directly in the browser via the `pencil` icon).

Append this `job` to the file:
```yml
  chip_tool:
    needs: rebuild_lighting_app
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@aa759c6c94d3800c55b8601f21ba4b2371704cb7

      - name: Install AVH API and Websocket
        run: npm install @arm-avh/avh-api websocket --save

      - name: Run script
        env:
          API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.API_TOKEN }}
        run: node .github/workflows/chip_tool.js
```
Commit change when done.

This job invokes the following `JavaScript` which will transmit the `on/off` commands to the `chip-tool` instance via the `Websocket` interface.

Create file `.github/workflows/chip_tool.js`, containing the below:
```js
const readline = require('readline')
const { ArmApi, ApiClient } = require('@arm-avh/avh-api');
const W3CWebSocket = require('websocket').w3cwebsocket;

const BearerAuth = ApiClient.instance.authentications['BearerAuth']
const api = new ArmApi()

function delay(time) {
	return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, time));
}

async function main() {
	console.log('Logging in...');
	const apiToken = process.env.API_TOKEN
	const authInfo = await api.v1AuthLogin({ apiToken });
	BearerAuth.accessToken = authInfo.token
	
	console.log("Locate instance named chip-tool...");
	console.log("[User must edit JavaScript if instance has different name (or >10000 instances)]");
	let instances = await api.v1GetInstances()
	for(let i=0; i<10000; i++){
		var instance = instances[i];
		if (instance.name == "chip-tool") break;
	}
	
	console.log("Open Websocket...");
	let url = await api.v1GetInstanceConsole(instance.id);
	var mySocket = await new W3CWebSocket(url.url);
	
	mySocket.onopen = function() {
		console.log(`WebSocket open.`);};
	mySocket.onerror = function() {
		console.log('WebSocket Connection Error.')};
	
	console.log("Wait 60s to ensure lighting-app is initialized...");
	await delay(60000);
	
	console.log("Turn light on...");
	mySocket.send("./out/debug/chip-tool onoff on 0x11 1\n");
	
	console.log("Wait 5 seconds...");
	await delay(5000);
	
	console.log("Turn light off...");
	mySocket.send("./out/debug/chip-tool onoff off 0x11 1\n");
	
	console.log("Wait 5 seconds...");
	await delay(5000);
	
	console.log("Turn light on again...");
	mySocket.send("./out/debug/chip-tool onoff on 0x11 1\n");
	
	console.log("Wait 5 seconds...");
	await delay(5000);
	
	console.log("Turn light off again...");
	mySocket.send("./out/debug/chip-tool onoff off 0x11 1\n");
	
	console.log("Wait 5 seconds...");
	await delay(5000);
	
	console.log('Closing WebSocket...');
	mySocket.close();
		mySocket.onclose = function() {
		console.log(`WebSocket closed.`);};
	mySocket.onerror = function() {
		console.log('WebSocket Error.')};
	
	return;
}

main().catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
});
```
Note that the JavaScript refers to instance name `chip-tool`, and `API_TOKEN` secret. The `job` refers to the script `chip_tool.js`, as well as the `API_TOKEN` secret. If these were named differently, you will need to update the script(s) appropriately.

When all edits are complete and commited, return to the `Actions` tab, and enable the `Matter_CICD_Demo` workflow. The workflow contains:
```yml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
```
which allows the user to manually start a workflow run. Click on `Run workflow` (from `branch [ master ]`) to start a new workflow run.

### Follow progress in GitHub Actions

Navigate to the `Actions` tab of your GitHub repository, and open the current workflow to follow progress. Observe that there are now three `jobs`, with the jobs to run `lighting-app` and `chip-tool` executing in parallel. You can follow progress in GitHub Actions log, and observe `chip-tool` toggling `lighting-app` automatically. You will also see the commands appear in the `chip-tool` console.

Congratulations! You have entirely automated the process to build and test our applications.

## Next Steps

We have built up a rudimentary CI/CD environment to start `Matter` development. Through the powerful AVH API and workflow methodology of GitHub Actions and other similar technologies, it is possible to construct an intelligent and always available CI/CD scheme, instantiating (and terminating) Virtual Hardware targets as required for your unit tests in a highly scalable way.
